Jeff Langr -- Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development

To build, you need to define `googletest_framework_root` in the SConscript file.

You also need to install `libjsoncpp-dev`.  The include files location are
detected using `pkg-config`.

Langr uses a 3-space indent in his code archive, which is rather satanic.
